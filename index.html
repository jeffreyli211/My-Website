                  My name is Jeffrey Li. I'm a 21-year-old student from New York City, and
                  currently in my fourth and final year studying computer science at Boston
                  University.

                <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                  Much of my passion for computer science sparked from my love of video games
                  throughout my childhood. Growing up with two older brothers who constantly
                  brought home the latest games to play from various different genres. From
                  <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>, to <i>Resident Evil 2</i>, to
                  <i>Portal</i>, I quickly grew fond of the virtual worlds that all these
                  different titles brought me into. Upon entering my first year of college in 
                  2017, I carried this fascination with me as I wondered about what made them
                  tick. How do all the games that I fell in love with work? 
                  <!-- How did games evolve from simple, low-polygon models to
                  near-realism characters? What were the mechanics behind enemy AI responses to my
                  character's attacks? -->

                <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                  This curiosity drove me to explore the field of computer science. In the process
                  of learning the answers to my many questions about games and game development, I
                  discovered a new passion in the form of programming. Every new programming project
                  I took on felt like a new game I was playing, with a new type of puzzle to solve.

                This project was one of my first times being exposed to computer graphics and
                rendering methods, and demonstrates the fundamental technique of rasterizing
                lines and triangles on a digital canvas. Despite being a rather basic concept for
                shape-drawing, rasterization has proven to be very crucial within computer graphics,
                primarily in rendering 3D models of objects. Overall, its simplicity in concept
                paired with its significance in application made this project a great introduction
                into the world of computer graphics.
                <!--
                This project demonstrates the application of Bresenham's algorithm for line drawing
                on a two-dimensional canvas to rasterize lines and triangles. By specifying three
                vertices, the sides of the triangle are incrementally drawn, and the algorithm fills
                the lines of pixels between the sides. Smooth color shading was also implemented via
                bilinear interpolation to determine the color of each pixel in the triangle, based
                on the colors of its three endpoints. This was one of my first times being exposed
                to computer graphics and rendering techniques, and despite being a rather basic
                demonstration of shape-drawing, this rasterization technique has proven to be very
                fundamental within computer graphics, more specifically in the 3D rendering of
                triangle meshes to model objects.

                My next project focused on creating a 3D model creature, with the inclusion of movable
                joints. Diving further into the realm of computer graphics, this project demonstrates
                the foundations used to simulate animation in moving objects or animals. Given the many
                moving parts of a spider, I found it to be a perfect candidate to showcase these
                features. Although this project was more difficult than I originally anticipated, it was
                nonetheless a fun and challenging way to work in a 3D environment.

                Using the basic primitive shapes provided within Java's OpenGL library alongside the
                application of chained rotation transformations, this project focused on the creation
                of a 3D model creature, with multiple rotatable joints. Given the many moving parts of
                a spider, I found it to be a perfect reference model to showcase these concepts of 3D
                rotations and other types of transformations. Throughout this project, I was able to
                expose myself to many tasks that were new to me. For the first time, I manipulated
                simple 3D shapes to best fit the look of the spider I had envisioned in my mind.
                Every part of the model was created from scratch through transformations of a
                primitive shape, from the cyclinders with spherical end caps to form the leg
                components, to the spheres scaled to form the main body.

                in the tank has been implemented with swimming animations, and swims in the direction best
                suited for its role. More specifically, predators swim in the direction that best increases its
                chances of catching a prey, whereas a prey will swim to best increase its chances of escaping
                the surrounding predators.

                should choose the best route to move away from them, to avoid being eaten. One of the

              <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                My latest computer graphics project showcases the different techniques that are involved in
                creating a 3D scene, including the light sources and shading methods. One of my first
                primary objectives was to create objects which would display these techniques.
                Using the provided shapes in Java's OpenGL would have defeated the purpose of this project,
                due to its shading and lighting abstraction. Instead, I created these shapes from scratch
                via triangle meshes, using the same triangle rasterization approach as my
                <a href="#Triangle_Rasterization">first graphics project</a>. Adapted with the depth-buffer
                algorithm, the scene established a perspective-based view of multiple objects. Moving forward,
                I created different light sources in the scenes, including ambient lighting, infinite light
                sources, and point light sources. Lastly, I incorporated two different forms of shading to
                demonstrate different methods in smoothing light and reflection across surfaces: flat shading
                and Phong shading.
